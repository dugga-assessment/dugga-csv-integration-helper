# dugga-csv-integration-helper

This is a simple command line tool to help Dugga's customers to integrate through our CSV API.

# Getting started
Install python on the machine that will run the script. The script is only tested on python3.

Run `pip install`

Run the script

`python dugga_integration_helper.py <token> <path/to/file.csv>`

You have to get the token from Dugga support, support@dugga.com
You have to create the csv file from your own system. The script together with our integration backend will give you hints on how the CSV should be formatted so just start trying and you will get the information you need.

Some things has to be done from Dugga's side, like creating the schools you want to synchronize.
